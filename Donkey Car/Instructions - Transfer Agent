Instructions to run Donkey Car Simulator agent using Transfer Learning:

Ignore steps 1-4 if already done.

1. Go to https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar/releases and download DonkeySim zip file based on your system requirements.

2. Run the command pip install git+https://github.com/tawnkramer/gym-donkeycar.git

3. Open the python file: DonkeyCarTransfer.py

4. Define the path of the donkey_sim.x86_64 which can be found in the folder DonkeySim folder under the SIM_PATH variable on line 25.

5. Define the model path where you want to save the weights file and make sure the folder is made prior to running the code, this is done under under MODEL_PATH on line 26. (make sure to give a new name everytime to the weights file to make new weight file everytime code is run)
(to test make it transferWeights.h5)

6. Make sure the MODEL_TYPE=1 for running the model to train the agent from ground up.

7. Run the command: python DonkeyCartransfer.py

8. This also generates the tensorboard logs which creates train folder under logs and make sure train folder name is changed everytime you run the python file.

9. To run the weights file in test mode, run the command: python DonkeyCartransfer.py --test
