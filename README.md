Objective: 
The goal of our project is to demonstrate how Transfer Learning can be used across simulators and eventually in a real life environment. <br />
The process of learning knowledge is done by using Reinforcement Learning (RL). For our project, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is preferred as our RL algorithm as it outperforms many other RL algorithms on most continuous control environments.<br />
